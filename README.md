# prog_1_data_analysis

This is a project for my Programming 1 class. 

In this project I will analyse few thousand best selling games from the online platform [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/search/?filter=topsellers&page=1).

For each game I will collect the following data:

* Name of the game
* Release date
* Genres of the game
* Number of all reviews and the amount of positive reviews
* Number of recent reviews and the amount of positive reviews
* Developer and publisher
* Price of the game
* Bundles in which the game is available
* Available additional content for the games
* Most recent announcements
* Game attributes
* Game awards and external scores
* Minimum and reccomended system requirements

A few of the questions I will try to answer are:

* Is there a corelation between the price of the game and its publishers?
* Which developers/publishers have the best rated games? The most awarded games? 
* Are people more likely to review expensive games?
* Do reviews of the game tend to change if there is a recent announcement?
* Are more demanding games also more expensive?
