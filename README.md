# prog_1_data_analysis

This is a project for my Programming 1 class. 

In this project I have analysed a few thousand best selling games from the online platform [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/search/?filter=topsellers&page=1).

For each game I have collected the following data:

* Name and description of the game
* Release date
* Metascore and age rating
* Genres of the game
* Number of all reviews and the amount of positive reviews
* Number of recent reviews and the amount of positive recent reviews
* Developer and publisher
* Price of the game
* Bundles in which the game is available
* Available additional content for the games
* Game attributes
* Minimum and reccomended system requirements

A few of the questions I have tried to answer are:

* Is there a correlation between the price of the game and its publisher?
* Which developers/publishers have the best rated games?
* Are people more likely to review expensive games?
* How much more computationaly demanding are games becoming with time?
* Is it possible to predict game's tags using it's description?

From the data I have concluded that games are becoming more and more computationaly demanding with time, in accordance with [Moore's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law). Based on the user reviews, the developer most consistently releasing good games is `Fireproof games`, with the series `The Room`. 
It turned out that predicting tags from the game's description is very difficult, most likely because there is apparently almost no relation between the two.
