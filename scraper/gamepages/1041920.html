This time around, we're joined by Bri, who worked with us on If Found... and is back on board for Dreamfeel NEXT. We talk about the development progress as always before letting Bri tell you a bit more about herself and her role on the game,  we answer a question about getting into writing for games and Llaura chats about 10 years of A MAZE. Until next month,\n\nTake care,\nTeam Dreamfeel\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGlossary of Contents:\n\n1) Introductions\n\n2) Development Updates\n\n3) Meet Bri!\n\n4) Writing for Games\n\n5) New video series\n\n6) A MAZE\n\n7) Shoutouts\n\n8) Wrap-Up\n\n\n\n\n[b]Introductions[\/b]\n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nHey! welcome to our next update which is our August update on everything we did in July basically. I'm Llaura. I'm the Director, Co-writer at Dreamfeel. Eve, do you want to introduce yourself? \n\n[b]Eve:[\/b]\n\nI'm Eve, hi yeah. I am the Co-writer and Producer for Dreamfeel and yeah, lovely to be here again! \n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nBri, do you want to introduce yourself?\n\n[b]Bri: [\/b]\n\nHi! I'm Bri. I work on kind of general unity stuff and rigging and posing and stuff like that. \n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nCool yeah, we'll jump into it in a second. Bri worked on If Found... with us. She came in the summer before we released and had a really awesome impact on the game and then last but not least, we have Alex who does all our video stuff and will edit out all this dead air whenever it happens\n\n[b]Alexandra:[\/b]\n\nTrue, true! \n\n\n\n[b]Development Updates[\/b]\n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nSo, we will start with what we did and then we'll chat, Bri, about what you do specifically but we'll just have a general chat about what we did this month. We'll just jump right in! So, I think we mentioned in our last update which was only like three weeks ago, maybe it was less, I think we were a bit late with that one that the script had just been finished so that was a huge milestone we hit and actually I think we're gonna start including like little progress bars so like bzzzt, 100% for script draft 1.0 and now script draft 2.0 is at like 15% bzzzt.\n\nbut once you have kind of the full picture of a game, that's when you can really start shaping it. So ,I think probably the comparison with If Found for this was, I would say September of 2019, was when we had a full draft that was fairly decent. So, what was working or was not working in script draft 1.0, Eve? \n\n[b]Eve:[\/b]\n\nWell there was one character who definitely didn't work. The Poochie of our new game. \n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nYeah that's what I've been calling poor Lorcan. We added this character who had to be in every single scene and then when he wasn't in a scene, everyone had to be asking \"Where's Lorcan?\". That was because Lorcan was added late because we thought we needed this other character and we had already planned out all the scenes so we just put him in every scene basically but yeah, we don't need him. He's gone, no Poochie. \n\n[b]Eve:[\/b]\n\nI think his name still exists, maybe for a side character because I quite like the name Lorcan. \n\n[b]Llaura: [\/b]\n\nYeah, there'll probably still be a character named Lorcan.\n\n[b]Eve:[\/b]\n\nYeah, they will be mostly irrelevant.\n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nThe interesting thing about this game as compared to If Found... as a little tidbit is  that we have a large main cast. It's not ridiculously big but there's half a dozen main characters whereas If Found, Kasio was the main point of view and you could say Shans\/An\u00fa is almost as big but not really whereas in this game, there's six main characters at least right now who have almost equal points of view. \n\n[b]Eve:[\/b]\n\nIt's true! \n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nThat's a big reveal!\n\n[b]Eve:[\/b]\n\nYeah, I guess it is. Figuring out how to juggle that and how to make sure that all of those characters have time and space to develop has been a really interesting challenge. We are not quite there yet but we get closer and closer. \n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nI think the other thing that this 1.0 draft has let us do is see what areas we need for the game. I think since finishing it over July, one of the big story changes was changing the setting in that we've kind of streamlined it rather than every single scene happening somewhere completely different. We are more gonna be based around a kind of central theme of settings, which means we'll get the game done sooner which is nice but also thematically, it works a lot better than what we've been working on. It goes back to what we planned at the start of the year and the end of last year except now we have a really clear sense of how the story progresses. That's a big thing and then on the development front, we're kind of splitting work into three streams basically because we're all working on Unity which is like part of the reason why Bri is here, to help us with unity and stuff. As well as originally, it was animating and posing but also Bri can just do so many things. It was just like \"oh yeah, help us with this\".\n\nThe trick with having lots of people working in Unity is lots of people stepping on each other's toes and having to redo bits and pieces so with this latest draft of the script, we find all these scenes are being rewritten now, this implementation isn't exactly what we wanted. So, to avoid that going forward, even though our script is fairly tight, besides  the writing is going to be changed. We are moving to just having the art be done separately from the whiteboxing. So we've mentioned whiteboxing before. It's where you plan out a level. So, our plan over the rest of this year to whitebox the entire game so we get it done by December and have everything playable, except it's going to look horrid. It's going to be all cubes and then at the same time, our team will be working on on all the environments and we're not going to worry about meshing those together until next year. That's next year's problem but it means the art is gonna be what we expect the environments to work like but we're not gonna be trying to get the mechanics to work essentially yet um. So, that's two streams. The third stream is just polishing the mechanics with one area basically where the art is how it should be and that's a big change. Any thoughts not from a production point of view, Eve? \n\n[b]Eve:[\/b]\n\nIt makes a lot of sense and hopefully it will help to smooth things out. It certainly means that you and I can kind of speed ahead Llaura, which is nice. Just kind of rapidly iterate on various scenes and stuff and check the script and see how it feels to kind of play that, which is really nice because a lot of time when you write something for games, you can write it on the page and it seems fine and then you play it and you're like hmm no! \n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nWe finished the build last week actually and I didn't think we were going to finish one because I wasn't happy with how the mechanics were working but we did that thing where \"Okay, here's just the environments and you can see them and walk through them\", which is really nice and then I just put in the white box as its own little scene and that white box plays really well. You can see how the cameras work and all the different effects but it's just ugly you know and funnily enough that scene, it's not going to exist as it is in game so if we spend time putting art in that and everything would have been just wasted time. \n\nI'm looking forward...we're gonna have the first act done this month so in terms of white box alpha, here's our next progress bar. We're, I'd say, five percent done and hopefully every month we get another 20% done so that by December, we have the whole game done and then next year is working on beta! Programming wise, we have been developing tools and such and effects and everything. Not much we can talk about. We improved the dialogue tool a lot and and I think while we didn't get it done for last week's build, I think we have it going forward and you got all the dialogue into that scene afterwards so quickly or how the speech bubbles work specifically. \n\n[b]Eve:[\/b]\n\nYeah, it's it's a really strong improvement. It will make our lives a lot easier so thank you Tim! \n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nSo then, that's all our development things. Script 2.0, 15% percent and i don't know... how long do you think that's gonna take? I think like three months or so, we should definitely have that pretty tight. \n\n[b]Eve:[\/b]\n\nI think the way we're planning to do it is a little bit more like we'll write a scene and then we'll put it into a whitebox and then we'll write another scene and put it in. So, the script itself might take a bit longer but it'll also be more polished because each scene will have at least one immediate revision. \n\n\n\n[b]Meet Bri![\/b]\n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nSo Bri, I thought it was cool to get you on board. We mentioned you last time. You're back with us now about six weeks or so. Maybe two months?  \n\n[b]Bri:[\/b]\n\nYeah, about that! \n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nYou used to be with us. You probably did the colour of the image that's behind you didn't you? \n\n[b]Bri:[\/b]\n\nYeah, I did! \n\n[b]Eve:[\/b]\n\nand for me! \n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nand the colour of Eve's one too. That was awesome. \n\n[b]Bri:[\/b]\n\nYes, all of that. \n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nBri is responsible for a lot of the colouring in the game, specifically scenes that were fully coloured. The house one was really good and then you also did lots of Unity for If Found... What else did you do on If Found... \n\n[b]Bri:[\/b]\n\nI did nearly pretty much all of the menus and the UI for that. \n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nYou did something we posted on Twitter recently, a hundred different versions of the logo that we didn't end up using. \n\n[b]Bri:[\/b]\n\nOh so many! So, so many! \n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nI actually really liked some of them. It's a pity we didn't get to use them.\n\n[b]Eve:[\/b]\n\nThey were very stylish. \n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nYou were very much a generalist. You can do a bit of everything. I know you through Dublin and through specifically, you went to TUD and did games there. So, you got like a grounding in game design as well as you kind of specialize in art yourself. What kind of stuff are you interested in doing? \n\n[b]Bri:[\/b]\n\nI kind of really enjoy being a generalist. I kind of just like taking whatever's thrown at me and being able to learn whatever I need to and adapt to different skill sets because I personally believe that nearly every part of game development is very interesting to me. So I like to have a hand in whatever.\n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nThe last day you were looking into cloths which is really cool so we have a very realistic looking cloth that looks awesome. \n\n[b]Bri:[\/b]\n\nYeah, we got we have some really cool cloth physics right now. So, it adds to the cool movement of the scenes and characters. \n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nI mean, maybe we should just wrap everything in cloth. Go full Journey, have cloth everywhere.\n\n[b]Bri:[\/b]\n\nOh god!\n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nYou also do loads of commissions online and stuff in between...like you weren't working with us for a bit but we're happy to have you back. \n\n[b]Bri:[\/b]\n\nYeah in my personal time I take commissions on Twitter and stuff. I mostly do single image characters or I kind of bounce around and I've been doing a lot of Twitch commissions and stuff for people. which is really cool. \n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nIs that profile pics and emojis or what? \n\n[b]Bri:[\/b]\n\nEmotes, overlays, any assets needed for Twitch stuff. Stuff like that.\n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nCool! \n\n[b]Bri:[\/b]\n\nIt's been really fun! \n\n\n\n[b]Writing for Games[\/b]\n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nI think that's the main things. We had one question to talk about, I guess. It was about how to get into writing in games. Alex, is that correct? \n\n[b]Alexandra:[\/b]\n\nYeah, that was a question I didn't see in time for our question time last time around.\n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nEve, you probably have a lot of good insight on this one. \n\n[b]Eve:[\/b]\n\nOh boy, it's hard is the first thing and it can be very discouraging. There are a lot more talented writers than there are decent paying jobs in games. So, the main things I would say are make your own games and they don't have to be fancy. Use Twine or Ren'Py or Bitsy. Bitsy is really good, highly recommend it and just try writing little stories because you'll learn a lot as well about pacing and stuff. Pacing in games works super differently to other mediums so it's it's definitely good practice and then send your C.V. out a lot. Oh god, sorry I have so many friends who are game writers and who are...I don't know\n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nUnderemployed?\n\n[b]Eve:[\/b]\n\nSo talented and so underemployed and I'm just like \"Please, I want all of these people to have lovely jobs\". \n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nYou talked about something there. I think to get the job, you need to have the material to show for it. There's not necessarily a games writing degree you can do or anything and even if you did, what would matter is still what you can show off it. So, it really is what you create but I think if you are into games and care about games and writing and such, I think the most important thing is you creating anyway so rather than go and work for some AAA company where you write one character's backstory or something, just make your own games and put them out there. It's hard to make a living at it. It's hard to make a living in the 21st century but you don't have to make a living at it to do it. If you can because it also doesn't pay very well unfortunately. So if you do it at all, that's a success. \n\n[b]Eve:[\/b]\n\nThere was a good thread on Twitter recently of writers talking about where they get their income from and some quite famous writers, writers who win awards and stuff were like \"Yeah, writing's not my day job. I write novels in my free time and I also do this other thing and it can be a bit startling if you're just kind of a fan you think \"Oh, I assumed you were making money\" and it turns out no because writers don't make any money. \n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nMy favourite gamemaker and potentially my favourite writer is Stephen Murphy (thecatamites) and he's making the ...of the Killer games at the moment. They're so good! He sells his games but he doesn't make a living at it and he very self-consciously doesn't want to join the industry and make a living at it in that way. So, there are other avenues. Obviously maybe not as many people are playing his games as are playing Apex Legends, I don't know, I mean obviously but yeah I think if you make art, it's like it's cool to have a big impact on fewer people. \n\n[b]Eve:[\/b]\n\nCapitalism and our culture in general tends to devalue stuff that is not done for money and that doesn't make a profit, that isn't seen by tons of people but there's so much value in all art and community-based art is the much more historical and traditional version of art. Art that you make for your friends, for your family, that's how most people in generations past made art. So, there's nothing to be ashamed of if that's what you can do to tell the stories that you want to tell. You should absolutely do that and it's very beautiful. \n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nEven if you do want to make a living out of it, you still have to start with doing it for free. \n\n[b]Eve:[\/b]\n\nIt's true, it's true! \n\n[b]Llaura: [\/b]\n\nI saw someone on Twitter talk recently about how you shouldn't work for someone who's kind of self-financing and that's a pretty hot take but in a lot of ways... \n\n[b]Eve:[\/b]\n\nIt's amazing! \n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nI think \"be careful about it\" because it's very easy to guilt trip and to get people to work extra hours and do all this extra stuff and not pay for it or \"Oh, we'll do revenue share!\" or something and it's like right yeah... just if you're going to do it, do it that you own it yourself. So, rather than doing it for Joe Schmo, if Joe Schmo is sharing it equal with you, okay cool! \n\nbut if they're saying \"Oh, I'll pay you five percent of what we make\". I'll just make my own thing. \n\n[b]Eve:[\/b]\n\nYeah, that is good advice. \n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nOk! \n\n[b]Eve:[\/b]\n\nI thought it was going to be a much spicier take than it actually was. Just don't fall for scammers who say \"Please do all my work for me\".\n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nThey don't think of themselves as scammers but... \n\n[b]Eve:[\/b]\n\nNo, it's true.\n\n[b]Alexandra:[\/b]\n\nI was also going to say as well we shared a Twitter thread a couple weeks back of writing resources.\n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nOh really? \n\n[b]Alexandra:[\/b]\n\nStuff to get started in the industry so I will put those in the show notes. \n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nYeah, awesome! \n\n[b]Alexandra:[\/b]\n\n...for anyone who's interested. \n\n\n\n[b]New video series[\/b]\n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nSo Alex, what's up with you this weather? \n\n[b]Alexandra:[\/b]\n\nNew series potentially starting very soon as well. Kind of an interview or chat series that we're hoping to get the first episode out next week or the week afterwards. Yeah, it's really exciting to add another new format to the YouTube stuff and hopefully you'll all enjoy it. \n\n\n\n[b]A MAZE[\/b]\n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nA MAZE was 10 years old, the berlin festival, so they had on past winners such as myself. I won the Grand Prize for Curtain so it was really cool to chat with everyone and what's really neat about that is the person who wins comes back the next year and judges the the following year's games so there's a real through line and they definitely pick games outside the norm, often indie games space can be very American-centric. A MAZE, one of the big focuses is getting just the sheer highest number of different countries involved as possible. They do great stuff reaching out to various countries.  They have a really strong connection with South Africa in particular but they reach out across the globe to get developers from different kind of communities which is cool. \n\nThere's obviously a big European focus as well, continental Europe, and then we're nominated for the IGDA awards this month and we were nominated for the GDC awards which is very fancy. We didn't get to sit at the fancy dining tables as it was in San Francisco. I did that once, I sat with a friend who was nominated for the IGFs. It's so strange and then all the plebs are in the seats at the back. It's so silly! \n\nbut it's fun, it's like it's a celebration of cool indie games stuff and speaking of which, Annapurna had their direct last week. It was a really cool celebration, they had a really good line-up so I'm very excited to see what comes from Annapurna. It's a interesting startup!\n\n[b]Alexandra:[\/b]\n\nRagtag publisher! (what I meant to say but word soup just came out instead - editor)\n\n\n\n[b]Shoutouts[\/b]\n\n[b]Eve:[\/b]\n\nI wanted to shout out that I was part of a game jam that ran for a couple months and it finished last month. It was for the Otome game jam and so you can go play it. It is a cute little game called Fated about working in a caf\u00e9 and dating Shakespeare characters. I had a lot of fun working on it. \n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nYou did the art for it, right? \n\n[b]Eve:[\/b]\n\nI did some of the background art, my friend AK did the character sprites. They are really, really good and I also wrote one of the characters.\n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nCool, that's awesome!\n\n[b]Eve:[\/b]\n\nYeah!\n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nand that's with the the Vow Together people, right? \n\n[b]Eve:[\/b]\n\nYeah.\n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nSweet! Bri, do you have any last shout outs? \n\n[b]Bri:[\/b]\n\nGo support No Longer Home. \n\n[b]Eve:[\/b]\n\nYeah! \n\n[b]Alexandra:[\/b]\n\nYeah, there we go! \n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nNo Longer Home is out now. I'm excited to play it. I mean I love all of Cel's and Hana's games and Eli worked on If Found. They also do great stuff so three really awesome non-binary game devs and they also worked with a bunch of other really rad people and made No Longer Home. I played the demo and it was really good so I am excited to play the full thing and it's so cool to see it come together. \n\n[b]Eve:[\/b]\n\nIt's been a really nice journey following the Kickstarter and stuff so yeah i'm just proud of them for getting it out. \n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nIf you like queer games, if you like narrative games, if you love Kentucky Route Zero there's a lot of Kentucky Route Zero influence in it but it's definitely its own thing. It's such a unique sense of space and world and the characters are just so real. It's two non-binary characters after college being like \"What the hell do we do with our lives?\" or \"What happens now?\". \n\n[b]Eve:[\/b]\n\nIf you have any answers, I'd like them please.\n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nI mean, college must be a while ago for you, Eve. I know we're the Millennial generation. We're still dealing with it. \n\n[b]Eve:[\/b]\n\nyeah no, college was ten years ago. Let's not talk about it.\n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nCan i go invisible? oh my god! Whoosh! \n\n\n\n[b]Wrap-Up[\/b]\n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nTake care everybody, we'll see you soon. We'll see you in four or five weeks for the next one! \n\n[b]Eve:[\/b]\n\nSounds good! Bye everybody! \n\n[b]Bri:[\/b]\n\nBye!","commentcount":2,"tags":["mod_reviewed","ModAct_848946987_1629726008_0","ModAct_848946987_1629729408_4"],"language":0,"hidden":0,"forum_topic_id":"3046109410088236777","event_gid":"2950407918013688575","voteupcount":16,"votedowncount":1},"published":1,"hidden":0,"rtime32_visibility_start":1629725520,"rtime32_visibility_end":0,"broadcaster_accountid":0,"follower_count":0,"ignore_count":0,"forum_topic_id":"3046109410088236777","rtime32_last_modified":1634973188,"news_post_gid":"0","rtime_mod_reviewed":1629729409,"featured_app_tagid":0,"referenced_appids":[],"build_id":0,"build_branch":"","votes_up":16,"votes_down":1,"comment_type":"ForumTopic","gidfeature":"2283834583182379762","gidfeature2":"3046109410088236777"},{"gid":"4428711422883020320","clan_steamid":"103582791465256362","event_name":"Dreamfeel Development Update - June 2021 Transcript","event_type":28,"appid":1041920,"server_address":"","server_password":"","rtime32_start_time":1626800820,"rtime32_end_time":1626805801,"comment_count":0,"creator_steamid":"76561198928206481","last_update_steamid":"76561198928206481","event_notes":"see announcement body","jsondata":"{\"localized_subtitle\":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],\"localized_summary\":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],\"localized_title_image\":[\"93e91522919898e8a24e8a227db507d91a6d5d0d.png\",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],\"localized_capsule_image\":[\"9091bcbbfb3ae137efb14bb074c94a8148d0a302.png\",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],\"localized_spotlight_image\":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],\"bSaleEnabled\":false,\"sale_show_creator\":false,\"sale_sections\":[],\"sale_browsemore_text\":\"\",\"sale_browsemore_url\":\"\",\"sale_browsemore_color\":\"\",\"sale_browsemore_bgcolor\":\"\",\"localized_sale_header\":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],\"localized_sale_overlay\":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],\"localized_sale_product_banner\":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],\"localized_sale_product_mobile_banner\":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],\"sale_font\":\"\",\"sale_background_color\":\"\",\"sale_header_offset\":150,\"referenced_appids\":[],\"bBroadcastEnabled\":false,\"broadcastChatSetting\":\"hide\",\"default_broadcast_title\":\"#Broadcast_default_title_dev\",\"localized_broadcast_title\":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],\"localized_broadcast_left_image\":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],\"localized_broadcast_right_image\":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],\"broadcast_whitelist\":[],\"bScheduleEnabled\":false,\"scheduleEntries\":[]}","announcement_body":{"gid":"4428711422883020321","clanid":"35734954","posterid":"76561198928206481","headline":"Dreamfeel Development Update - June 2021 Transcript","posttime":1626800853,"updatetime":1626803715,"body":"[previewyoutube=uf8rPVVnpQc;leftthumb][\/previewyoutube]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHey again,\n\nAnother month, another update video!

Welcome to the second Dreamfeel update, for June? We have a larger cast of characters and people with us here today. I am joined by Eve-Golden Woods. Eve: Hi!\n\n[b] Llaura: [\/b]\n\n There is myself, Llaura and over here on the right, we\u2019ve got Adriel. Karen. \n\n[b] Karen:[\/b]\n \n Hey!\n\n[b]Llaura: [\/b]\n\n and Alex.\n\n[b] Alex:[\/b]\n \n Hi, how\u2019s it going?\n\n[b] Llaura:[\/b]\n\nSo, we\u2019ll get to a proper intro to these new faces so y\u2019all can know who everybody is. So yeah, the first point on my bullet point is reception to the first video. It seemed people liked it! \n\n[b]Alex:[\/b] \n\nMhm \n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b] \n\nWe are definitely a bit late with this one, for reasons you\u2019ll find out. Mostly that we were a bit late finishing the build this month. That\u2019s the reason, you found out. \n\n[b]Everyone: [\/b]\n\n*Laughs* \n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n \nBut yeah, things have gone really well and yeah, I think it\u2019s probably good to start off with introductions then.\n\n\n\n[b]Karen and Adriel [\/b]\n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b] \n\nSo, our new game has a bunch of new faces on the team., particularly these two people!, and we have some old faces returning. Bri Chew is back with us, who worked on If Found\u2026 So, we\u2019ll have to have to get Bri and Liadh in on the next call but it\u2019s really nice to have Bri back and they\u2019ve been helping out with some animations for characters and Unity bits and pieces. But a lot of the new look of the art comes from our new 3D artists, who I will let introduce themselves! We\u2019ll go alphabetically, with Adriel then. \n\n[b]Adriel:[\/b]\n\nHi, I\u2019m Adriel. I\u2019m a 3D artist, I\u2019ve been working freelance for a few years maybe and I also do translation on the side. \n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n \nYeah, like you\u2019re living\u2026 You are French. I mean, you\u2019re not even just living in France! \n\n[b]Adriel:[\/b] \n\n*laughs* \n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nI mean, specific to which language you did translation for.\n\n[b]Adriel:[\/b]\n \nEnglish to French, yes. \n\n[b]Llaura: [\/b]\n\nCool! And Karen? \n\n[b]Karen:[\/b]\n\nHi. Ok, so, I\u2019m a 2D and 3D artist that usually does character art. Been making games for ten years now! So, yeah *Laughs* \n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nWhat are some games that you both have worked on then? \n\n[b]Karen:[\/b]\n \nRecently worked on I Am Dead, that was released by Hollow Ponds. Also, The Wolf\u2019s Bite, which is an indie game. \n\n[b]Llaura: [\/b]\n\nWhich is coming out, right? \n\n[b]Karen:[\/b]\n \nThat was released a while ago. Right now, I\u2019m working on Seasonspree. \n\n[b]Llaura: [\/b]\n\nRight, yeah. Of course! \n\n[b]Karen:[\/b]\n \nWhich is another small, cute game.\n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n \nAdriel, any projects you want to shout out or anything?\n\n[b]Adriel:[\/b]\n \nI think one of my favorite recent games was Bird Alone, which I did the translation for. \n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n \nOh yeah and Eli, who we worked with on If Found, lots of great trans folks! Eli worked on the music for that game as well, which is cool.\n\n\n\n[b]Monthly progress[\/b]\n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n \nSo, Adriel and Karen have been working with us since February, March? And the game kind of underwent an aesthetic shift at that point to quite a different direction, which we mentioned last month. Over March, April, May, we were just nailing down that art style. Then this month, we were putting that art directly into the game for the first time for playable sections, which was really, really fun. \n\nSo, the big milestone we reached this week, what was in our build, was what we had last month except with nice art. Not even everything we had last month because nice art takes a while but most of what we had last month plus nice art and some improved mechanics and everything. Yeah, how have ye found working on the project? How does it compare to other games? \n\n[b]Adriel: [\/b]\n\nWanna start, Karen? *laughs*\n\n[b]Karen:[\/b]\n\nYeah sure. Well, it's pretty chilled, right? It's very experimental and fun so I've been getting the chance to do a bunch of different things and learn different bits which is really nice. It's always nice to have a smaller team because you get to do a bunch of, you get your own bit on each single aspect of the game because it's very collaborative in that regard so yeah, been having a great time! \n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nCool! \n\n[b]Adriel:[\/b]\n\nYeah, same! I think for me, it's the longest project I've been working on since I've been freelance and also it's the one in which I'm the most integrated in the team and it really makes a difference because we're really working together with the other artists and it's really cool. \n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nYeah, I really like that we have this pipeline now that largely starts with Liadh doing the illustrations and then Adriel is taking that and making the first models and creating out the areas, Bri integrating it into Unity and then Karen who I guess, we haven't specified this. Adriel's largely doing the environment right now and Karen, you're doing characters but then you're also doing the kind of finishing touches on the environment and colors so I mean you have a lot of hats right now but you seem to like having lots of hats anyway I think.\n\n[b]Everyone:[\/b]\n\n*laughs*\n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nYeah, it's going well. I'm really happy with how it's coming together and yeah, we've got some nice environments and we've been trying out...it's definitely a unique art style. We can't...again, we don't want to give too many specifics away but it's definitely a unique art style. So, part of this is also the shaders and everything. This morning we had a big conversation with Tim like \"How do we optimize this? \u201cWhy can't we just release this only for beefy 2060 graphics cards?\u201d and then they're like why? It's simple looking graphics. Why does it need a graphics card? Well, there's all these tricks and things. \n\nSo, the art has been one big thing we've done this month. Also in the scene, we've been working on mechanics. So, for example, one that we probably can talk about is...we've had a system of dialogue boxes in the game since we started in October or so and we got rid of that this month because they were just looking a bit ugly and a bit didn't really fit and it was just kind of gamey...replace them with speech bubbles which yeah, it looks really nice. I mean,  Eve, what do you think? \n\n[b]Eve:[\/b]\n\nYeah, I'm really happy with the speech bubbles and the version we have now is placeholder but even so, it already looks really good and it feels much more kind of interesting because it pulls you into the world rather than placing a layer between you and the world, which is always the frustrating thing. I think there's ways of doing that where it's aesthetically interesting. People will always shout out Persona 5, which has this incredibly distinctive style for its dialog boxes but I really do love the way speech bubbles become part of the space in a kind of interesting way. \n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nYeah, I think we were trying to rip off Persona 5 for a bit but ultimately, we found the speech bubbles in the world felt more integrated and there's some kind of design-y things where they pull you through the world as well as you try to reach the next speech bubble \n\nAnd the thing about the speech bubbles as well is that any kind of screenshot looks really nice. It doesn't look artificial, it looks like a nice piece of art and when the speech bubble is in-world and in place on the screen, there's a nice combination there and then there's two other mechanics that kind of got fleshed out. We made them a bit like juicier, with a flash and a shake and it's definitely getting there! We finished that on Monday and then the last few days, we have been going over the story which I'll get to in a second but also we have some great thoughts about mechanics which I think is kind of the last piece of the puzzle for us. \n\nWhat's going to happen in the finale, possibly if it all works out and yeah, I think I feel really happy with where the mechanics are going now. There's a unique mechanic. It's not as obvious from the get-go as If Found... probably but there are some unique mechanics and that's still our ethos of putting the narrative and the flow first rather than shooting things. There's no shooting, well maybe they're shooting things who knows. Let's find out! \n\n\n\n[b]Script 1.0[\/b]\n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nAnd then the other big thing we finished this month and credit goes to Eve, I think, is version 1.0 of the script! \n\n[b]Eve:[\/b]\n\nYeah, which has immediately been scrapped in favor of planning version 2.0. \n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nThat was great though. We had a lot of conversations, a lot of detail but then you went and actually wrote the scenes. \n\n[b]Eve:[\/b]\n\nIt's interesting that I was thinking having script 1.0 and having the playable build that we have now would be it. But both of those things were kind of really the catalyst for  \"oh, this is the last mechanic we need!\" and \"this is how we're going to change the script for version 2.0 because now we know the mechanics better\" \n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nYeah.\n\n[b]Eve:[\/b]\n\nSo it's really nice how that stuff integrates where you build something and then you're like \"oh now that I can see how this plays, I know how the narrative should help to make that deeper and richer\" and vice versa.\n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nYeah and until you have a draft, you can't tell what the script is missing or what parts work or not. So hopefully, we can start sharing that slightly more widely, not publicly obviously but we can start sharing that with people so we get feedback on it which would be really great.\n\n\n\n[b]Pride Month[\/b]\n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nAnd then because it's pride month or it was pride month, which is coo,l you have all these extra commitments. *Laughs*\n\nBut it was fun. There was a really cool Apple article and a bunch of panels like the Microsoft one, we were on Twitch which was wild, that was fun. \n\n\n\n[b]TikTok[\/b]\n\nAlso, one big thing last month that we started was TikTok. So, how's that going Alex?\n\n[b]Alex: [\/b]\n\nIt's going pretty well at the moment. People have seemed very receptive to it and we've had- I mean the first video did particularly well but the other ones seem to be kind of pretty solid.\n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nI think it's just nice as well. I think stuff like Twitter is so disposable and you can become a Twitter personality but it's no one really cares except for getting your serotonin burst or seeing some snarky funny person on twitter? I don't think we need Dreamfeel adding to that whereas making videos, hopefully this one and the TikTok ones which are super short little videos I think is actually stuff that sticks around. It can be referenced in the future and it's a bit meatier. That's my theory.     \n\n[b]Alex:[\/b]\n\nYeah totally, I think-\n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nIt's a Llaura theory!\n\n[b]Alex:[\/b]\n\nIt's a game theory! It's also nice to just work on smaller videos as well and to be able to take these little moments from bigger stuff or for example, the first video was a cut together version of our two trailers for If Found but yeah to be able to play around with that stuff a bit more and be a bit more experimental, a bit more kind of interesting with the editing *laughs* \n\nBecause this stuff is pretty standard in terms of everything. It's just kind of \"yeah, cut out the dead air\u201d and stuff like that or like our pauses and um's and stuff like that whereas the TikTok stuff you kind of have to think of what's gonna grab someone's attention and maintain it for about 30 or 40 seconds so yeah it's been really cool! \n\n\n\nPoll and Questions\n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nCool! That's our update for the month, let's jump into- we had a little poll question and there's a couple other questions from people on Instagram and Twitter, I think. Eve, do you have the poll question? \n\n[b]Eve:[\/b]\n\nI do! So, for this month's poll question, we asked people what their favorite section of If Found was and we had three options plus leave others in the comments. Number one by a decent margin was Gig & Attic, which got almost 50% of the votes then the end of the world and the epilogue and then break-in and chipper. I'm not particularly surprised that the gig and attic were the most popular because it's very fun and high energy and then very sweet and tender and I think those are moments that stick with people. \n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nYeah, it was kind of hard. We had four options so one of them we threw away almost because no one wants to be typing a comment to vote for other and then end of the world and epilogue being the climax with finally burning the book and then you're going into space or whatever and the reunion and the drawing and everything. That was initially out in front actually when I looked last night so it was a surprise comeback from the gig and I struggled, I didn't know what I was gonna put for the third one so those are the two options I was definitely gonna pick. Eve, do you have a favorite chapter? \n\n[b]Eve:[\/b]\n\nI do really like Christmas\n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nI thought so, yeah! \n\n[b]Eve:[\/b]\n\nit's so, i mean- it's one of the chapters that I really pushed to get into the game. I was like \"No, there must be a Christmas scene. We're doing Christmas.\" \n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nThat's because it was actually Christmas time or it was January and we thought \"The game is supposed to be out in three months. We can't add a whole other chapter!\" but  you were very adamant and I'm glad we did. It really worked.\n\n[b]Eve:[\/b]\n\nYes, I think this is true for me and it's probably true for a lot of other people too. For some reason Christmas is always when messy family conversations happen because you're kind of in this pressure cooker. Everyone's supposed to be having a good time and celebrating and so, of course, all of the things that are wrong immediately come to the surface and I thought that was a really good fit for where Kasio was at as well. \n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nAdriel, do you have a favorite chapter and Karen being two people who didn't work on the game and untainted by his development. \n\n[b]Adriel:[\/b]\n\n*Laughs* I think it's Christmas too for me. I've always had weird Christmases so, that hit close to home *laughs*\n\n[b]Karen:[\/b]\n\nYeah, I think for me, it's the gig. That was so fun! \n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nYeah, for me, it's either the bonus post credits scene or it is probably the gig. because that's one of the first scenes that was done and it kind of just, you know, while obviously it got adapted while the story changed, it was always a fun chapter. Alex, do you have one?\n\n[b]Alex:[\/b]\n\nYeah, I would actually say the moving in chapter. I really like- I think it captures that feeling of being in somebody's house that you're not- like you know them but you're not like overly familiar with them and then waking up and basically being like, it's kind of strange, you're going to the motions of having breakfast and that sort of thing. \n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nDo you know what- \n\n[b]Alex:[\/b]\n\nbut yeah, I just really like that. \n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nDo you know what's wild? I was talking to someone recently who...she spent lots of summers in Achill as a kid growing up and she said \"yeah, there's literally a gaff, a house that people used to squat in and go there and there's one thing we didn't get to show in the game was all the broken bottles and the floor and stuff, you know, which we had planned for but I think because Colum and Jack and Shans were in there already. They would have already cleared it up. Here's our lovely friend, the running out of time timer, so the Dreamfeel logo will go on top of this.\n\nAlright, so then there's a couple questions which are \"How is the sheep doing from that one scene doing? I hope they're fine. \n\n[b]Eve:[\/b]\n\nWhich scene has a sheep? \n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nWell, I mean that the key art has a sheep in the background but then there's also the diary that has the farmer looking after her sheep and stuff. I'm sure the sheep is doing good, you know just chilling grazing come come rain or shine. \n\n[b]Everyone:[\/b]\n\n*Laughs*\n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nI hope the person who sent this picture in, it's a dog, their profile picture is a dog. I hope the doggo is doing good too. \n\nthen Sailor Moon asks \"how are y'all doing?\"\n\n[b]Everyone:[\/b]\n\n*Laughs*\n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\nGood! \n\n[b]Eve:[\/b]\nPretty good! \n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nYeah, it's nice finishing a milestone. It's always a bit of relief because we delayed finishing it by a few days because we didn't want it- there was no point crunching for a random end of month thing so we delayed it until the start of this week and I'm glad we did that but even still, it's nice to have it \"oh it's sent off now\". We don't have to worry about it but otherwise yeah, doing good, I got a doggo recently. We adopted a four-year-old French bulldog and she is really stupid but very lovable.\n\n[b]Eve:[\/b]\n\nFrankly, that's the best kind of pet. Yeah, my dad's dog is also very- He is all heart, no brain. \n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nOne last question from someone who wants to hear news about our next project. Well, ye got some news and then Camille also wants to know \"was there anything that needed to be cut out from the game\u201d, I guess? Anything that we wanted to do by the end, I don't know. \n\n[b]Eve:[\/b]\n\nI think- \n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nThere's lots of fun- \n\n[b]Eve:[\/b]\n\nYeah sorry you go ahead, Llaura. \n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nThere's lots of parts that didn't make it but yeah, is there anything that we specifically cut that we wanted to get in? \n\n[b]Eve:[\/b]\n\nThe only thing I can think of is that in the original demo there was- the zooming was a very kind of a vocal mechanic as well as the erasing \n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nYeah! \n\n[b]Eve:[\/b]\n\nEven though there is a lot of zooming in If Found, now it's done more automatically so you don't really see it in the same way. \n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nYeah \n\n[b]Eve:[\/b]\n\nand I think we have talked about wanting to take that and do a different game that really focuses on the zooming part. \n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nYeah, there was a big decision made about it a year out from a release, I'd say and kind of the complexity of the game with free control and it just didn't- it didn't flow very well and maybe there were solutions but at the point, we were just more focused on figuring out the story \n\nand so we kind of simplified the movement mechanic and everything, which has pros and cons. Some people say \"All I'm doing is clicking\". So, I think there's definitely another game there where we can make zooming and free movement more of a thing. So, that's probably the biggest thing and maybe if we ever got to do like a super special edition, we might include other control mechanics which might tweak it a little bit. Actually one thing that I realized afterwards was because there are moments where we can move freely. I don't know why we didn't make the diary sections free moving especially when we tweaked them after release so maybe that's one thing that I would have liked to have changed. Yeah but otherwise you know it's the result of the time that went into it and the limitations and, we come up with solutions because \"oh crap we have only this much time\" or we got to do x, y and z and for the most part that all worked out really well yeah so...Oh look at the cute cat in the background aaaaaaah! Staring at the wall, does she do that often? \n\n[b]Karen:[\/b]\n\nShe does! The other co-worker.\n\n\n\n[b]Wrap-Up[\/b]\n\n[b]Llaura:[\/b]\n\nAlright, we'll wrap it up there then. Thanks for watching update number two. Thanks to Adriel and Karen for joining us and hopefully you guys can hop on in the future \n\nAnd sometime soon we'll show off all the lovely art that we've been making and people's minds will explode! Bye, thanks everyone!\n\n[b]Everyone:[\/b]\n\nBye!","commentcount":3,"tags":["mod_reviewed","ModAct_848946987_1626805550_0"],"language":0,"hidden":0,"forum_topic_id":"5208960061406891305","event_gid":"4428711422883020320","voteupcount":21,"votedowncount":2},"published":1,"hidden":0,"rtime32_visibility_start":1626800820,"rtime32_visibility_end":0,"broadcaster_accountid":0,"follower_count":0,"ignore_count":0,"forum_topic_id":"5208960061406891305","rtime32_last_modified":1632257314,"news_post_gid":"0","rtime_mod_reviewed":1626805551,"featured_app_tagid":0,"referenced_appids":[],"build_id":0,"build_branch":"","votes_up":21,"votes_down":2,"comment_type":"ForumTopic","gidfeature":"2283834583182379762","gidfeature2":"5208960061406891305"}],"EventWebRowEmbed":{"bPreLoaded":true,"announcementGIDList":["2950407918013688576","4428711422883020321"],"last_update_event":[]}};
